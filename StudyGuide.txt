Here's the study guide:

Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning algorithms
Dependent vs. Independent Variables
Training vs. Testing data: train-validation-test split
Linear regression: residuals, linearization
Regression Analysis: parametric and non-parametric models, R-Squared and MSE
Logistic Regression: intercept, slope, cross-entropy
K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm: hyperparameters
Decision Trees (self-study): Leaf nodes and predictions
In all of the above, explain the algorithm
